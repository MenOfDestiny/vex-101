This course is designed to be an introduction to computer programming using robotics.

## VEX Robotics Introduction

VEX Robotics VR is an easy-to-use platform to help students learn Computer Science without a physical robot.

This class is loosely based on materials prepared by the educators at VEX Robotics.  More details and more in-depth learning can be found [here](https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/cs/computer-science-level-1-blocks).

## Getting Started

### What You Need

- A computer or tablet with internet access
- An open mind and willingness to learn

### How To Launch

Using your web browser, navigate to [https://vr.vex.com](https://vr.vex.com).  You should see a screen that looks like this:

### How To Load Examples

1. First, you will need to download the example files to your computer.  The easiest way to download them is to download a zip file of the entire directory. You can do this by clicking the `Code` menu and choosing `Download ZIP`. Once downloaded, you will need to unzip these files to have access to the individual example files on your computer.

1. In the VEX application in your browser, int the file menu (upper left corner), choose `Load From Your Device` and choose the file you want to load.

1. Once the file has been loaded into your virtual environment, you should see a screen similar to the following:

    > NOTE: If you do not see the Playground with the coral reef, click the `Playground` link at the top of the window.

1. Experiment with this program and all of the options and see how much trash you can pick up off the ocean floor.
